# Tissue-Specific Carcinogenicity Prediction Using Multi-Task Learning on Attention-based Graph Neural Networks

Title: Tissue-Specific Carcinogenicity Prediction Using Multi-Task Learning on Attention-based Graph Neural Networks

Authors: Yunju Song, Sunyong Yoo

## Description

We present a model that can provide interpretable predictions of tissue-specitif carcinogenicity of compounds using various multi-task learning approaches.
You can find the data and source code used in the paper.
In addition, we provide a Python file that can be used to generate predictions from the model we trained.
If you want, you can train and predict new datasets from the structure of the model we proposed.
